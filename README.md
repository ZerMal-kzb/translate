Collaboration program and contribution of translations to Filo and related. Here you'll find the final translations and source files for the translations.

> **WARNING**: Currently the **Website** and **Wiki** translation program is on hold due to the need for a transition to Crowdin. In the meantime we won't accept new translations in both projects.

### Do you speak a special language that Filo doesn't know? Don't be shy and show it off!
Currently our translation program requires you to have a **[Crowdin account](https://accounts.crowdin.com/login)**, as it's the main platform we use to manage translations.

### What's Crowdin?
Crowdin is a platform that we started to use at the beginning of August 2021 in order to facilitate the translation of Filo and related.

This repository has two objectives:
- Serve the translation files for Filo and related.
- Expose the source files of the translations.

### Are you interested in being part of the Filobot translation program?
No need to request access or anything like that, just register with Crowdin and access our project, and voila!

#### Rewards?
If you actively participate in the Filobot translation program, you'll receive a badge along with an exclusive role on our **[Discord server](https://filobot.xyz/discord)**.

#### Proofleader
If you are interested in the idea of being a Proofleader of a specific language, don't hesitate to let us know on our **[Discord server](https://filobot.xyz/discord)**.
